<h4>Getting there.....</h4>
<p>Even going from Russia to Tokyo is quite the journey.
But remember, it's not just the destination that makes it fun, it's also the journey.

<p>There are multiple flights to Tokyo from Heathrow both direct and connection flights so it's not really hard to get there.
  Just book a flight and you'll find yourself there somehow. The flight is quite pricey ranging from (averages) £800 - £1500 and the flight is also quite long at 14hrs.
  But don't let that put you off. The price is only high because of how far and how many people go there. If others can why can't you ?
  In conclusion, it's relatively easy to get to Tokyo via plane.
