  <p2><em>Tokyo</em>, the capital city of Japan, is a city where ultramodern architecture with its traditional counterpart.
    The city its self is a oxymoron filled from Robots roaming around the streets to traditional temples and shrines around the city.
    It is the centre of Japans business as the 11th most expensive city global and is ranked 1st as The World's Most Safest Cites.
    The question is less <em>'Why Tokyo ?'</em> and more <em>'Why not Tokyo ?'</em>
    Just remember you're not the only one who wants to go. With 24.04 million tourists going to Japan in 2016, wouldn't you want to be apart of the 2017 group ?
    So if you're still wondering "Why Japan ?" I think you should start thinking more about <em>"What to do there ?"</em> which will be explained further on.
