    The answer is simple, because it's the best place you could be.</p>

  <p2><em>Tokyo</em>, the capital city of Japan, is a city where ultramodern architecture with its traditional counterpart.
    The city its self is a oxymoron filled from Robots roaming around the streets to traditional temples and shrines around the city.
    It is the centre of Japans business as the 11th most expensive city global and is ranked 1st as The World's Most Safest Cites.
    The question is less <em>'Why Tokyo ?'</em> and more <em>'Why not Tokyo ?'</em>
    Just remember you're not the only one who wants to go. With 24.04 million tourists going to Japan in 2016, wouldn't you want to be apart of the 2017 group ?
    So if you're still wondering "Why Japan ?" I think you should start thinking more about <em>"What to do there ?"</em> which will be explained further on.

<h4>Getting there.....</h4>
<p>Even going from Russia to Tokyo is quite the journey.
But remember, it's not just the destination that makes it fun, it's also the journey.

<span class="icon flight-black-48"></span>
<p>There are multiple flights to Tokyo from Heathrow both direct and connection flights so it's not really hard to get there.
  Just book a flight and you'll find yourself there somehow. The flight is quite pricey ranging from (averages) £800 - £1500 and the flight is also quite long at 14hrs.
  But don't let that put you off. The price is only high because of how far and how many people go there. If others can why can't you ?
  In conclusion, it's relatively easy to get to Tokyo via plane.
